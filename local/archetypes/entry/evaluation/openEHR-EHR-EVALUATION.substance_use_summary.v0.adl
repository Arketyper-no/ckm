This archetype is to be used to record information about both current and previous substance use behaviour.

The specific scope of this archetype is on documentation about the use of all types of addictive substances, except tobacco and alcohol. The \"Specific substance\" cluster allows for recording of specific details, routes and episodes about each type of substance used and can be repeated once per substance.

In some situations the individual will only consume one type of alcoholic beverage, such as beer. If other substances are used, the details will be recorded in another instance of the 'Specific substance' cluster.

The history of waxing and waning of use for each substance over time can be captured using the repeatable 'Per episode' cluster. This cluster of data elements allows for a very detailed pattern of substance use behaviour to be recorded for each type of substance used such as daily cannabis smoking, alongside MDMA use every Friday night and occasional cocaine use. 

Triggers for closing one episode and commencing a new one will largely reflect local data collection preferences, including if the individual: 
- quits for a significant period of time (which will likely be locally defined); or
- significantly changes their amount of use or pattern of their substance use.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of substance use habits within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Overall description' data element.">
			keywords = <"consumption", "substance", "use", "usage", "dependence">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record information about tobacco use - use EVALUATION.tobacco_smoking_summary or EVALUATION.smokeless_tobacco_summary for this purpose.

Not to be used to record information about alcohol use - use EVALUATION.alcohol_use_summary for this purpose.

Not to be used to record information about the use of addictive substances as part of a normal diet, such as sugar, or caffeine in coffee or tea.

Not to be used to record event-or period-based information about substance use, such as actual daily use or the average use over a specified period of time - use the OBSERVATION.substance_use archetype.">
