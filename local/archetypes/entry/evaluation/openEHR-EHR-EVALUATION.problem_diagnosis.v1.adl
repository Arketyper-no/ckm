Use to record all problems or diagnoses, including those with context-specific qualifiers such as past/present, primary/secondary, active/inactive etc. These qualifiers can be archetyped separately and included in the ‘Status’ slot, because their use varies in different settings.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record 'Differential Diagnoses' - use the EVALUATION.differential diagnosis archetype.

Not to be used to record 'Reason for Encounter' - use the EVALUATION.reason_for_encounter archetype.

Not to be used to record 'Presenting Complaint' - which is information captured early in the encounter, usually prior to full assessment and will be represented using a separate EVALUATION archetype.

Not to be used to record procedures - use the ACTION.Procedure_undertaken archetype.

Not to be used to record symptoms or signs - these should be recorded as part of a patient story or history.  A problem such as 'Chest pain' may masquerade as a symptom, however in this context we are recording it as a problem the person has.">
