This archeype has deliberately been loosely modelled to be inclusive of the broadest range of adverse reactions, including but not limited to allergies, sensitivities, intolerances and side effects which warrant avoiding exposure to the identified substance.

Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
- Systematic questioning in any consultation, for example:
--- Allergy to penicilin? Yes, No, Unknown.
--- Reaction to sticking plasters? Yes, No, Unknown.

The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data element would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.

The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about a procedure that has been performed at any time in the past and information about a procedure performed within a specified time interval - for example the difference between \"Do you have influenza?\" compared to \"Have you had influenza in the past 4 weeks?\"

The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.

This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the presence of a adverse reaction, it is recommended that clinical system record and persist the specific details about the adverse reaction (such as the date of clinical recognition) using the EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk archetype.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used to record details about the presence or absence of a adverse reaction, outside of a screening context. Use EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis or EVALUATION.exclusion_specific for these purposes.

Not to be used to to create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about procedures that has been carried out in the past. Use the OBSERVATION.procedure_screening for this purpose.

Not to be used to to create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about adverse reactions, use an appropriate archetype for this purpose.

Not to be used to record details about a simple selection list where a question may be recorded as either \"present\" or \"indeterminate\". Use OBSERVATION.selection_list for this purpose.">
