			purpose = <"For recording the findings observed during the examination of a body fluid at an identified body site or from an identified body source.">
			use = <"Use to record a narrative description of the overall findings observed during the  of a body fluid from an identified body source. This initial draft archetype consists only of the core examination pattern data elements (as per CLUSTER.exam_pattern) and will likely be expanded further over time as specific clinical requirements are identified.

Body fluids usually refer to fluids excreted or secreted from the body including, but not limited to:
- Amniotic fluid;
- Blood and plasma;
- Cerebrospinal fluid;
- Discharge;
- Excreta, including urine and liquid faeces
- Exudate;
- Joint fluid;
- Pus;
- Saliva; and
- Sweat.

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination findings' SLOT within the CLUSTER.exam_cervix, CLUSTER.exam.wound and similar archetypes, and also in the 'Additional details' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.urinalysis archetype. It can also be used within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording measurements of fluid volume - use OBSERVATION archetypes for this purpose. For example OBSERVATION.fluid_output.

Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom.

Not to be used to record the results of a urinalysis test - use OBSERVATION.urinalysis. This archetype may be included in the 'Additional details' SLOT to provide additional context to the test result.

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations or measurements or test results - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure or OBSERVATION.imaging_exam.">
