			purpose = <"To share critical clinical information recorded by the sending healthcare organisation/provider to the healthcare organisation/provider who is taking over responsbility for provision of health care for the subject.">
			use = <"Use to provide a summary clinical report about about an episode, or period, of care provided by a healthcare organisation or provider, to support continuity of care as the subject moves under the care or another healthcare organisation or provider, including a return to their original community. This document will typically convey information about events that occurred during the period of care, diagnoses, investigation results, management at discharge and plans for follow-up.

Typical senders of this report will be healthcare providers located within a clinical facility including, but not limited to:
- clinicians providing care during a hospital inpatient admission; and
- clinicians providing acute treatment or assessment as part of an emergency department visit.

Typical recipients of this report will be healthcare providers including, but not limited to: 
- the subject's usual primary healthcare provider or health service;
- within a specialist, residential aged care or rehabilitation facility; and 
- all health professionals who need to participate in post-transfer care of the subject.

A discharge summary can be considered as a specific type of transfer of care summary.

Multiple transfer of care summaries may be required to accompany the subject in any single transfer, to ensure that the full breadth of medical, nursing and other care information is shared with the appropriate receiving healthcare providers.">
