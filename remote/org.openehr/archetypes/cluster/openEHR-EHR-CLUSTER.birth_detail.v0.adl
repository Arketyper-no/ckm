This archetype has been designed to be nested:
- in the 'Birth detail' SLOT within the EVALUATION.pregnancy_summary archetype, to capture details about an infant born to the mother; and
- in the 'Birth detail' SLOT within the EVALUATION.birth_summary archetype, to capture or reuse details about the birth of the individual.">
