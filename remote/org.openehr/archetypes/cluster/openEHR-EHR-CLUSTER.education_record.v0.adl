Multiple instances of this archetype captured over time will result in the aggregation of a history of past and present education and training.

An active, or current education or training may be implied from a 'Date commenced' but no 'Date ceased'. 

An individual may carry out many simultaneous educations or trainings. Each education or training should be recorded in a separate instance of this archetype.

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Education record' SLOT within the EVALUATION.education_summary archetype, but can also be used within any other ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.

There may be some apparent or real overlap between the data elements in this archetype and education or training details that may be stored as demographic details in clinical or administrative systems. These data elements have been designed specifically to support clinical purposes.">

Not to be used to record information about the education or training of an individual at a specific point in time (for example, on June 16, 2014) or during a relative interval of time (for example 'in the past 30 days'. Use an appropriate OBSERVATION archetype for this purpose.">
