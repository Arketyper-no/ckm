A NIHSS foi originalmente concebida como uma ferramenta de pesquisa para medir os dados de referência sobre doentes em ensaios clínicos de AVC agudo. Atualmente, a escala é também amplamente utilizada como uma ferramenta de avaliação clínica para avaliar a acuidade dos pacientes com AVC, determinar o tratamento adequado e prever o resultado do paciente.">
			use = <"Analisar os itens da escala do AVC na ordem listada . Registrar o desempenho em cada categoria , após exame de cada item e subitem . Não voltar atrás e mudar pontuações.

O clínico deve registrar as respostas ao realizar o exame e trabalhar rapidamente . Exceto quando indicado, o paciente não deve ser treinado (ou seja , pedidos repetidos ao paciente para fazer um esforço especial ) .">
