This archetype has been designed as a framework for objectively documenting the use or administration of a single substance. While it supports recognition of abuse and dependence, it is not intended exclusively for this purpose.

A typical use of this archetype will be related to a diary record of use or consumption of substances.

Substances that fall within the scope of this archetype include harmful or potentially addictive substances, legal and illegal substances, as well as medications that are misused. Misuse may involve administration without clinical supervision, use for non-recommended purposes, or consumption in quantities or frequencies that exceed safe dosages. Examples of substances that may be recorded using this archetype include but are not limited to:
- tobacco;
- alcohol;
- caffeine;
- nicotine and other clinically significant components of vaping liquid;
- psychostimulants;
- barbiturates;
- cannabis;
- hallucinogens;
- opioids;
- GHB;
- MDMA;
- sniffing of hydrocarbons or other solvents;
- \"bath salts\"; and
- medication administration, such as a laxative for purposes other than relief of constipation, beta blockers to reduce the heart rate in elite athletes and anabolic steroids in weight lifters. (en)">
