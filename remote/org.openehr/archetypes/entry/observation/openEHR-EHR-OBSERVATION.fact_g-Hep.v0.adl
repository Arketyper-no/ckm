Several of the score item response scores are reversed on scoring, to convert a low response on a negatively phrased question to a high quality of life score, or opposite. Reversal is performed by subtracting the item response from 4.

The subscale scores are calculated by summing the item scores after reversing the relevant item responses, multiplying by the number of items in the subscale, and dividing by the number of items answered.
