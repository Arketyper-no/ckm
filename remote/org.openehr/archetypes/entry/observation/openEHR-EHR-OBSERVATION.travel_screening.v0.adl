			purpose = <"To create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about travel activity.">
			use = <"Use to create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about travel activity.

Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
- Infectious disease surveillance
- Creating a patient profile in a disease registry
- Systematic questioning in any consultation related to patterns of disease.

The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. Each data element would usually be renamed in a template to represent the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted to align with local requirements by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case. 

Utilising this framework within a template can enable documentation of a broad range of question/answer pairs such as:
- Have you been overseas in the past 6 weeks? Yes, No, Unknown.
- Have you travelled to Africa in the past 1 year? Yes, No, Unknown.
- Have you travelled to an area where malaria is endemic in the past 2 weeks? Yes, No, Unknown.
- Have you ever travelled to an active war zone?

The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to a point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about an investigation or test that has been done at any time in the past and information about an investigation or test done within a specified time interval - for example, the difference between \"Have you ever travelled to an area with high radiation activity?\" compared to \"Have you travelled to an area with high radiation activity during the last four weeks?\".

The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.

This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies an investigation has been carried out, additional details required for persistence as part of a clinical record can be captured using specific test result archetypes.">
