Use to provide a framework in which CLUSTER archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings - for example, CLUSTER.exam_pupils. 

In addition, the CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording data not related to the physical examination of the eyes.

Not to be used to record data about eye testing - use specific purpose-built OBSERVATION archetypes. For example, OBSERVATION .visual_acuity or OBSERVATION.visual_field_measurement.

Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom.

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations or measurements or test results - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure or OBSERVATION.imaging_exam.">
